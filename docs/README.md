# Documentation Hub

All project-wide documentation lives inside this `docs/` directory. Use it to capture design decisions, operating procedures, and onboarding materials that span multiple services.

## Contents

- [`environment.md`](environment.md) – Environment variable organization, naming conventions, and secret management policies.
- [`architecture.md`](architecture.md) – High-level system overview and component relationships (placeholder for future content).
- Additional guides can be added as the project evolves (e.g., runbooks, style guides, release checklists).

When adding new documents, update this index to keep contributors oriented.
